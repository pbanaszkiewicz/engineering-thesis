Module cases
============

Cases presented here are based on the Arduino Leonardo and Uno containers done by
Zygmunt Wojcik (@zygmuntw).

# Modifications

Modifications I introduced:

* removed wholes for USB and other plugs
* moved PCB legs so that they work with Arduino Pro
* PCB legs: instead of pins I made wells (ie. substract instead of union)
* resized the case for module B and moved PCB legs around a little.
